   * ### Expanding the pull request collection response
   *
   * LaunchDarkly supports expanding the pull request collection response to include additional fields.
   *
   * To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include the following:
   *
   * * `deployments` includes details on all of the deployments associated with each pull request
   * * `flagReferences` includes details on all of the references to flags in each pull request
   * * `leadTime` includes details about the lead time of the pull request for each stage
   *
   * For example, use `?expand=deployments` to include the `deployments` field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.
