   * ](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/ld-docs/api/contexts/get-context-attribute-names) instead of this endpoint.

   * Get all in-use user attributes in the specified environment. The set of in-use attributes typically consists of all attributes seen within the past 30 days.
   *
   * @deprecated method: This will be removed in a future release, please migrate away from it as soon as possible.
