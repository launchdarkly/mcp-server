   * @remarks
   * Get details about all experiments in an environment.
   *
   * ### Filtering experiments
   *
   * LaunchDarkly supports the `filter` query param for filtering, with the following fields:
   *
   * - `flagKey` filters for only experiments that use the flag with the given key.
   * - `metricKey` filters for only experiments that use the metric with the given key.
   * - `status` filters for only experiments with an iteration with the given status. An iteration can have the status `not_started`, `running` or `stopped`.
   *
   * For example, `filter=flagKey:my-flag,status:running,metricKey:page-load-ms` filters for experiments for the given flag key and the given metric key which have a currently running iteration.
   *
   * ### Expanding the experiments response
   *
   * LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Get experiments" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.
   *
   * To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:
   *
   * - `previousIterations` includes all iterations prior to the current iteration. By default only the current iteration is included in the response.
   * - `draftIteration` includes the iteration which has not been started yet, if any.
   * - `secondaryMetrics` includes secondary metrics. By default only the primary metric is included in the response.
   * - `treatments` includes all treatment and parameter details. By default treatment data is not included in the response.
   *
   * For example, `expand=draftIteration,treatments` includes the `draftIteration` and `treatments` fields in the response. If fields that you request with the `expand` query parameter are empty, they are not included in the response.

  /**
   * Patch experiment
   *
   * @remarks
   * Update an experiment. Updating an experiment uses the semantic patch format.
   *
   * To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/api#updates-using-semantic-patch).
   *
   * ### Instructions
   *
   * Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating experiments.
   *
   * #### updateName
   *
   * Updates the experiment name.
   *
   * ##### Parameters
   *
   * - `value`: The new name.
   *
   * Here's an example:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "instructions": [{
   *     "kind": "updateName",
   *     "value": "Example updated experiment name"
   *   }]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * #### updateDescription
   *
   * Updates the experiment description.
   *
   * ##### Parameters
   *
   * - `value`: The new description.
   *
   * Here's an example:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "instructions": [{
   *     "kind": "updateDescription",
   *     "value": "Example updated description"
   *   }]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * #### startIteration
   *
   * Starts a new iteration for this experiment. You must [create a new iteration](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/ld-docs/api/experiments/create-iteration) before calling this instruction.
   *
   * An iteration may not be started until it meets the following criteria:
   *
   * * Its associated flag is toggled on and is not archived
   * * Its `randomizationUnit` is set
   * * At least one of its `treatments` has a non-zero `allocationPercent`
   *
   * ##### Parameters
   *
   * - `changeJustification`: The reason for starting a new iteration. Required when you call `startIteration` on an already running experiment, otherwise optional.
   *
   * Here's an example:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "instructions": [{
   *     "kind": "startIteration",
   *     "changeJustification": "It's time to start a new iteration"
   *   }]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * #### stopIteration
   *
   * Stops the current iteration for this experiment.
   *
   * ##### Parameters
   *
   * - `winningTreatmentId`: The ID of the winning treatment. Treatment IDs are returned as part of the [Get experiment](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/ld-docs/api/experiments/get-experiment) response. They are the `_id` of each element in the `treatments` array.
   * - `winningReason`: The reason for the winner
   *
   * Here's an example:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "instructions": [{
   *     "kind": "stopIteration",
   *     "winningTreatmentId": "3a548ec2-72ac-4e59-8518-5c24f5609ccf",
   *     "winningReason": "Example reason to stop the iteration"
   *   }]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * #### archiveExperiment
   *
   * Archives this experiment. Archived experiments are hidden by default in the LaunchDarkly user interface. You cannot start new iterations for archived experiments.
   *
   * Here's an example:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "instructions": [{ "kind": "archiveExperiment" }]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * #### restoreExperiment
   *
   * Restores an archived experiment. After restoring an experiment, you can start new iterations for it again.
   *
   * Here's an example:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "instructions": [{ "kind": "restoreExperiment" }]
   * }
   * ```
