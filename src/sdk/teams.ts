  /**
   * List teams
   *
   * @remarks
   * Return a list of teams.
   *
   * By default, this returns the first 20 teams. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.
   *
   * ### Filtering teams
   *
   * LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:
   *
   * - `query` is a string that matches against the teams' names and keys. It is not case-sensitive.
   *   - A request with `query:abc` returns teams with the string `abc` in their name or key.
   * - `nomembers` is a boolean that filters the list of teams who have 0 members
   *   - A request with `nomembers:true` returns teams that have 0 members
   *   - A request with `nomembers:false` returns teams that have 1 or more members
   *
   * ### Expanding the teams response
   * LaunchDarkly supports expanding several fields in the "List teams" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.
   *
   * To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:
   *
   * * `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.
   * * `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to the team.
   * * `roleAttributes` includes a list of the role attributes that you have assigned to the team.
   * * `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has any write access to.
   * * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.
   *
   * For example, `expand=members,maintainers` includes the `members` and `maintainers` fields in the response.

  /**
   * Update team
   *
   * @remarks
   * Perform a partial update to a team. Updating a team uses the semantic patch format.
   *
   * To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/api#updates-using-semantic-patch).
   *
   * ### Instructions
   *
   * Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating teams. Several of the instructions require one or more member IDs as parameters. The member ID is returned as part of the [List account members](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/ld-docs/api/account-members/get-members) response. It is the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.

  /**
   * Add multiple members to team
   *
   * @remarks
   * Add multiple members to an existing team by uploading a CSV file of member email addresses. Your CSV file must include email addresses in the first column. You can include data in additional columns, but LaunchDarkly ignores all data outside the first column. Headers are optional. To learn more, read [Manage team members](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/account/manage-teams#manage-team-members).
   *
   * **Members are only added on a `201` response.** A `207` indicates the CSV file contains a combination of valid and invalid entries. A `207` results in no members being added to the team.
   *
   * On a `207` response, if an entry contains bad input, the `message` field contains the row number as well as the reason for the error. The `message` field is omitted if the entry is valid.
   *

   *       "value": "invalid email format"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Message | Resolution
   * --- | ---
   * Empty row | This line is blank. Add an email address and try again.
   * Duplicate entry | This email address appears in the file twice. Remove the email from the file and try again.
   * Email already exists in the specified team | This member is already on your team. Remove the email from the file and try again.
   * Invalid formatting | This email address is not formatted correctly. Fix the formatting and try again.
   * Email does not belong to a LaunchDarkly member | The email address doesn't belong to a LaunchDarkly account member. Invite them to LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team.
   *
   * On a `400` response, the `message` field may contain errors specific to this endpoint.
   *
   * Example `400` response:
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "code": "invalid_request",
   *   "message": "Unable to process file"
   * }
   * ```

   * File exceeds 25mb | Break up your file into multiple files of less than 25mbs each.
   * All emails have invalid formatting | None of the email addresses in the file are in the correct format. Fix the formatting and try again.
   * All emails belong to existing team members | All listed members are already on this team. Populate the file with member emails that do not belong to the team and try again.
   * File is empty | The CSV file does not contain any email addresses. Populate the file and try again.
