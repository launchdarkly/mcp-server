   * ### Expanding the applications response
   *
   * LaunchDarkly supports expanding the "Get applications" response to include additional fields.
   *
   * To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include the following:
   *
   * * `flags` includes details on the flags that have been evaluated by the application
   *
   * For example, use `?expand=flags` to include the `flags` field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.
