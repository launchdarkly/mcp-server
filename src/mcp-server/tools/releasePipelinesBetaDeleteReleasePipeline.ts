Deletes a release pipeline.

You cannot delete the default release pipeline.

If you want to delete a release pipeline that is currently the default, create a second release pipeline and set it as the default. Then delete the first release pipeline. To change the default release pipeline, use the [Update project](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/ld-docs/api/projects/patch-project) API to set the \`defaultReleasePipelineKey\`.
