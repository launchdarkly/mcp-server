Get a single account member by member ID.

\`me\` is a reserved value for the \`id\` parameter that returns the caller's member information.

### Expanding the member response
LaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the "Get member" response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.

To expand the response, append the \`expand\` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:

* \`roleAttributes\` includes a list of the role attributes that you have assigned to the member.

For example, \`expand=roleAttributes\` includes \`roleAttributes\` field in the response.
