### Expanding the deployment collection response

LaunchDarkly supports expanding the deployment collection response to include additional fields.

To expand the response, append the \`expand\` query parameter and include the following:

* \`pullRequests\` includes details on all of the pull requests associated with each deployment
* \`flagReferences\` includes details on all of the references to flags in each deployment

For example, use \`?expand=pullRequests\` to include the \`pullRequests\` field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.
