### Expanding the teams response
LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Create team" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.

To expand the response, append the \`expand\` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:

* \`members\` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.
* \`roles\` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to the team.
* \`projects\` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has any write access to.
* \`maintainers\` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.

For example, \`expand=members,roles\` includes the \`members\` and \`roles\` fields in the response.
