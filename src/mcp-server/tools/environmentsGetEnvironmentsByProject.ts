  description: `List environments

Return a list of environments for the specified project.

By default, this returns the first 20 environments. Page through this list with the \`limit\` parameter and by following the \`first\`, \`prev\`, \`next\`, and \`last\` links in the \`_links\` field that returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the \`first\` and \`prev\` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.

### Filtering environments

LaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:
- \`query\` is a string that matches against the environments' names and keys. It is not case sensitive.
- \`tags\` is a \`+\`-separated list of environment tags. It filters the list of environments that have all of the tags in the list.

For example, the filter \`filter=query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2\` matches environments with the string \`abc\` in their name or key and also are tagged with \`tag-1\` and \`tag-2\`. The filter is not case-sensitive.

The documented values for \`filter\` query parameters are prior to URL encoding. For example, the \`+\` in \`filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2\` must be encoded to \`%2B\`.

### Sorting environments

LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for sorting:

- \`createdOn\` sorts by the creation date of the environment.
- \`critical\` sorts by whether the environments are marked as critical.
- \`name\` sorts by environment name.

For example, \`sort=name\` sorts the response by environment name in ascending order.
